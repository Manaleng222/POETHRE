## 🧠 How It Works

This is a **WPF desktop application** — no web server or browser required.  
User actions (add/edit/filter/scale) are processed by backend logic in C#, and the UI updates accordingly.

✔ UI built with **WPF XAML**  
✔ In‑memory list for storing recipes at runtime  
✔ Detailed filtering and scaling logic for enhanced usability
